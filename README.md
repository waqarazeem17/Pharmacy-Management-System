# 💊 Pharmacy Management System

This is a **console-based Pharmacy Management System** built using **C++** for the Computer Programming Lab (CSL-113) course at Bahria University. The system is designed to **automate pharmacy operations** such as inventory control, medicine purchases, and prescription record-keeping.

The project demonstrates how fundamental C++ programming concepts can be applied to develop a **real-life utility application** with structured data handling and file management.
